This model is subject to the terms in the license, which is to say that it may 
be used only with permission and consultation by J. B. Snively. This is not a 
release version. If "Found", please contact snivelyj@erau.edu.

Please refer to Clawpack 4.2 documentation and license terms.

HDF4 and other libraries needed for output files are included in ./hdf4libs,
and are subject to their individual license terms.

Two versions are provided: (Files labeled "Classic" or "ThirdOrder")
Classic uses mwaves=meqn, and is included until the two methods are unified in
a single Riemann solver. The ThirdOrder method applies a Lax-Liu limiting
scheme that eliminates the need for the external Clawpack limiting routines.
It uses only three "f-waves" for the Euler equations, as all limiters are
applied to the Eigenvector coefficients directly. This method is 15% faster
and effectively higher resolution. See example claw2ez file for reference on
settings. In both cases meqn includes the 5 Euler equations, any nspecadv  
advection equations, and any meqn-5-nspecadv continuity equations.

The code can be used either in cylindrical r-z or Cartesian x-z coordinates.
These can be selected in setprob.data.


To Compile: 
Edit Makefile to address any compiler-specific needs or library paths. 
Type "make xclawmpihdf"
	
To Run on Vega (324 processors, example case), 
qsub ./xclaw_launch
